#define WUKONG_1_2 "The Scriptures - sound!"
#define WUKONG_1_3 "All I ever wanted was a life in my mountain, free from you and your so-called merits."
#define WUKONG_1_4 "Those high above don't trust me, I understand that"
#define WUKONG_1_5 "and they send you in those knuckleheads to threaten me to obey and serve once more. I understand that too."
#define WUKONG_1_6 "But what I don't understand is "
#define WUKONG_1_7 "you BASTARDS killing my kind!"

#define ERLANG_1_1 "Stay back, stupid dog."
#define ERLANG_1_2 "Mark this, he's not just any monkey.  He's a monkey of merit."
#define ERLANG_1_3 "A monkey was made Buddha once."
#define ERLANG_1_4 "None other than me can challenge him to a duel."
#define ERLANG_1_5 "Look, monkey, I don't make a habit of fighting someone I've bested before."
#define ERLANG_1_6 "Here's my offer."
#define ERLANG_1_7 "If you lose, I'll take you to the Celestial court. They will stay and level your mountain."
#define ERLANG_1_8 "But if I lose, I shall certainly take revenge."
#define ERLANG_1_9 "And they will level your mountain nonetheless."
#define ERLANG_1_10 "How tragic would that be, huh? You are one of the court. We don't need to resort to violence."
#define ERLANG_1_11 "How about you bend the knees, admit the wrongs and we can put this behind us."

#define WUKONG_1_8 "Hahahahahaha."
#define WUKONG_1_9 "All these years, except for that pig, you're the one who talks the tallest tales."
#define WUKONG_1_10 "Good. I am entertained!"
#define WUKONG_1_11 "Speaking of entertainment, wouldn't it be fun if I pluck your extra eye out for my snack and allow YOU to keep the other two?"
#define WUKONG_1_12 "Because I'd hate to let you miss how I'll slaughter each mongrel of the court"
#define WUKONG_1_13 "those below, those above, and that black mutt of yours."
#define WUKONG_1_14 "Come at me, all of you."

#define ERLANG_1_12 "They gave you many chances"
#define ERLANG_1_13 "yet you spurned each one. Such ingratitude!"

#define ERLANG_1_14 "The Celestial Court welcomes you, foul monkey, yet you remain untamed!"
#define ERLANG_1_15 "None shall save you now!"

#define WUKONG_1_15 "Hahahahaha."
#define WUKONG_1_16 "Dear brother, your edge needs honing."
#define WUKONG_1_17 "Good, I was in need of a backscratcher!"
//fighting phase 2
#define ERLANG_1_16 "Foul monkey, taste my axe!"

#define WUKONG_1_18 "Brat! You call that a duel?"
#define WUKONG_1_19 "The glare up here is dazzling. Fight me in the woods if you have the guts."

#define WUKONG_1_20 "(I can't move...)"

#define OLDMONKEY_1_1 "And so ends the last tale of Sun Wukong, a hero who treasured his freedom above all else."
#define OLDMONKEY_1_2 "Buddhahood he attained, yes; but cumbersome He found the celestial rules"
#define OLDMONKEY_1_3 "For he yearned to come back and to revel in the simple joys with us."
#define OLDMONKEY_1_4 "Little did he know, his choice to forgo the life above only fueled their mistrust."

#define OLDMONKEY_1_5 "This stone has stood for countless days on the mountain"
#define OLDMONKEY_1_6 "Since my youth, they said that his remains lie within it"
#define OLDMONKEY_1_7 "Unbegotten, undying. Such is the nature of a stone monkey"
#define OLDMONKEY_1_8 "Though his body was broken, his spirit endures "
#define OLDMONKEY_1_9 "Into six relics he turned, and separately they escaped, choosing to stay hidden."
#define OLDMONKEY_1_10 "Those are the six senses of the Great Sage"
#define OLDMONKEY_1_11 "Yet no one has ever seen them. Not in centuries."
#define OLDMONKEY_1_12 "I'm old now. Venture through all the lands I cannot."
#define OLDMONKEY_1_13 "Yet among you there might be one who is destined, "
#define OLDMONKEY_1_14 "one that should recover all his scattered relics,"
#define OLDMONKEY_1_15 "and upon the return of the relics to Mount Tuaguo, he may yet rise again."
